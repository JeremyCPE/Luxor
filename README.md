# Luxor

Application to change the brightness and the gamma according to the user schedule.

However, according to this page : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wingdi/nf-wingdi-setdevicegammaramp Microsoft strongly recommand to not use the API that I'm using right now :/
It's working but not as clean as I wanted so this project may be abandonned to respect the Microsoft advice.

It's a project in .NET 8 C# Using Avalonia as Framework
